# TO DO LIST:

1. Make an empty array for the image objects
2. create the constructor function to instantiate them.
3. Test your objects via the array in the console
4. Write a function to display a single random image on page refresh
5. Put an event listener on the DOM element with the photo in it..
6. Create an event handler that, on 'click', will call the function that renders the image.
  -You should be able to keep clicking to see new images
7. Write the logic in the event handler to keep the same image from appearing twice in a row.
  -Put in a console.log() message to appear when it catches a duplicate. That is how you know it is working.
8. Track clicks on the image and also keep an ongoing tally of total clicks
9. Once that is working work on expanding to three simultaneous images. Your non-duplicating logic will need to be expanded and adapted
10. See if you can accurately capture clicks on any one of the three images by logging the name of the image you clicked.
11. Add a list and a chart.

 Keep going. AC(P) often. Remember that regular commits are key and that you do not need to push every time. They can add up.
 Work on branches as you move to a big new section of work that might break something you did previously. Makes for easy rollback points.
